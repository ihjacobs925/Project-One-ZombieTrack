# Project-One-ZombieTrack

#Game Idea: Zombie Track

You are an Olympic Sprinter heading down the home stretch all set to take home the Gold Medal;
1 catch, a Zombie outbreak has taken place and a group of them have spilled on to the track blocking
you from the finish line! You are still determined however, and must avoid the Zombies in your path to get to the finish
and live your dream of winning the Gold Medal!
